# Phi

This is a WordPress theme based on (forked from) the theme [leopard](https://github.com/iqbalrony/leopard) by [iqbalrony](https://github.com/iqbalrony). This was made for a blog site and I guarantee absolutely no additional functionality for anything other than that
- It has a light and dark theme for all you fellow nocturnal beings
- It uses PHP (leopard says PHP5.6+ but I tested it on 7.0 and 7.4 so who knows)
- You need WordPress 5.0 minimum apparently, but was tested on 5.9 and 6.0 and it worked fine
- It uses Bootstrap which I think is pretty nice
- It's dynamic (unless I messed it up really badly) and works on phones without looking awful

## Pictures
It looks like this
